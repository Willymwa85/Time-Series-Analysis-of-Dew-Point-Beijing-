# Time-Series-Analysis-of-Dew-Point-Beijing-
The analysis reveals that in the testing data, time series forecasting using the moving average technique produced moderate forecasting accuracy with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately 3.71 units, Mean Squared Error (MSE) indicating the magnitude of errors, and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of around 2.57 units. Lower error values are desirable for improved forecasting. Additionally, the training data exhibited a Dew Point concentration around bins 20-22 and 18-20, displaying a roughly normal distribution, while the testing data showed cyclicality in Dew Point values, possibly influenced by seasonal and meteorological factors in Beijing, China.
